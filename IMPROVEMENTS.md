# AceOfQuiz - Bug Fixes and Code Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Start Game Button Bug ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The "Start Game" button was reappearing after answering questions due to `updateHostControls()` being called in `showResults()` and `resetGame()` functions.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced the `updateHostControls()` function with improved logic to check visibility of other UI sections
- Added checks for results, game over, and question sections before showing the start button
- Re-enabled the function calls but with proper state management
- Now the button only appears when truly in waiting state with no other sections visible

### 2. Guest User Navigation ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Guest users had no way to return to the login/register screen once they entered the game.

**Solution**:
- Added a "Back to Login/Register" button that appears only for guest users
- Created `showAuthSection()` function to properly handle the transition back to authentication
- Updated `playAsGuest()` function to show the back button
- Updated `hideGameUI()` and `leaveGame()` functions to properly handle guest user navigation

## Code Improvements

### 1. Better State Management
- Improved the visibility logic for UI elements with comprehensive checks
- Better separation between guest and authenticated user experiences
